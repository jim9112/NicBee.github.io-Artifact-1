## Nicole Beller: GAM-495 Capstone 



### Refined Artifact #1 - *The Race*

**Tools Used**
 - Visual Studio 2017
 - Unreal Engine 4.19
 - Various YouTube tutorials
 - Unreal Engine documentation
 - Epic Games' Paragon: Morigesh download
   

**Inclusion**

One thing that makes this game stand out, compared to the others in my ePortfolio, is the ability to play the game through different cameras or viewpoints.  The original assignment asked us to make at least 2 other cameras, for a total of 3, but I decided to add a few more to get more familiar with how the cameras work.  To create the additional cameras, I made a CameraViews Actor and used C++ and Visual Studio 2017 to input the code.

I chose to add this game to my ePortfolio because I enjoyed working on the C++ code.  It was always a challenge working on this game because the code provided in the class was constantly outdated or incorrect, so I not only had to figure out what was wrong with the code, but I had to implement multiple changes to get everything to work properly.  

**Skills Learned**
  - Project images in 3D games by writing code that correctly applies principles of linear algebra
  - Develop path-finding classes using navigation meshes for creating character paths in 3D games
  - Construct collision detection classes with static mesh collision references through utilization of game physics
  - Utilize built-in camera system libraries to develop camera styles in 3D game environments
  - Implement event-based user interface systems and heads-up displays in creating basic graphical user interfaces
  
  **Highlighted Skills**
  - Graphic Interface Design: showcases my understanding of how the different cameras function in UE4; the player can access the view of multiple cameras while maneuvering through the castle.  
  - Game AI: showcases my understanding of how AI can function; I programmed different ways for the AI to move by having two of them travel on the same spline and using target points; I thought it would be interesting to have one AI access the target points randomly while the other follows the simple 1-2-3 pattern.
  - Game Physics: showcases my understanding of how pickups function and how I can connect a simple pickup to the HUD; with each rock picked up the HUD produces an updated count.
  - Programming: showcases the different programming approaches I took to create this game; I used C++ and blueprints and figured out multiple ways to incorporate functioning AI.
  
  
**Reflection**

This is the first artifact that I returned to, after nearly a year and while I’m impressed with my coding documentation, I wish I would have documented my process on creating the game. For example, I wish I wrote about how or why I added spline AI. While I like that they monitor a specific area the entire time, I wish I could have easily edited their path but since I didn’t document the ‘hows’ or ‘whys’, I would have to use the internet for research and at the moment, I lack the time required to give it the proper attention. It’s frustrating having a cool aspect to my game but not being able to change it in any way. For future reference, I intend to document everything I do when I’m working on a solo project, so when I return to it, I know exactly where I left off or how I was doing something, in case there’s an improvement to what I was working on or a better way to do something.

The feedback I received from my instructors was my concept was good and I was headed in the right direction but there was more I could do, more I could polish. My original game had a depleting bar but there was no point in it. I didn’t tie the bar into anything because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with the bar, aside from getting a passing grade to prove I learned how to do it. With this refined artifact, I decided to use the bar as a countdown; two of my maps have the countdown bar, that shows the player how much time they have left to find all of the items before they receive a Game Over. So, for this artifact, I had to learn how to tie a depleting bar to a timer which would then bring up a new widget blueprint. 
 
My original game was a simple map that had two different kinds of AI that ran according to either a randomized path or a set path. The goal was to collect the items but there were duplicates and the AI could collect an item or two. With this improvement, the core game is still the same, but now there are added difficulties, with time limits and additional collectible items. I also added new maps, to expand on my original map and added an exploding collectible in one of the higher difficulty maps. I didn’t change much, but I did improve upon my level design skills and I also added the Main Menu and a lose and win screen.
While working on this artifact, I also learned not to bite off more than I could chew. While taking this Capstone course, I’m also attending another course, a rather writing-intensive one, and with each artifact, I only had one week to refine them. I wanted to majorly improve each artifact, to prove to my instructor/s and myself that I have learned a lot during my time at Southern New Hampshire University and while I am impressed with what I accomplished, I do feel like I could have done better, had I only attended this Capstone course.
 
 My original idea for refining this game was to change the theme of each level. I wanted to keep the original realistic-castle theme to the Easy map but then wanted to add a cartoony-theme to the Hard map. For the Challenging map, I wanted to incorporate the two themes into one, which would have been interesting to see. Perhaps in the future, when I’m done with school and wanting to learn more about game design, I will be able to return to this game and make the improvements I originally thought of.
