## Nicole Beller: GAM-495 Capstone 



### Refined Artifact #1 - *The Race*

**Tools Used**
 - Visual Studio 2017
 - Unreal Engine 4.19
 - Various YouTube tutorials
 - Unreal Engine documentation
 - Epic Games' Paragon: Morigesh download
 
 **Skills Learned**
  - Project images in 3D games by writing code that correctly applies principles of linear algebra
  - Develop path-finding classes using navigation meshes for creating character paths in 3D games
  - Construct collision detection classes with static mesh collision references through utilization of game physics
  - Utilize built-in camera system libraries to develop camera styles in 3D game environments
  - Implement event-based user interface systems and heads-up displays in creating basic graphical user interfaces
  
  **Highlighted Skills**
  - Graphic Interface Design: showcases my understanding of how the different cameras function in UE4; the player can access the view of multiple cameras while maneuvering through the castle.  
  - Game AI: showcases my understanding of how AI can function; I programmed different ways for the AI to move by having two of them travel on the same spline and using target points; I thought it would be interesting to have one AI access the target points randomly while the other follows the simple 1-2-3 pattern.
  - Game Physics: showcases my understanding of how pickups function and how I can connect a simple pickup to the HUD; with each rock picked up the HUD produces an updated count.
  - Programming: showcases the different programming approaches I took to create this game; I used C++ and blueprints and figured out multiple ways to incorporate functioning AI.
  

**Inclusion**

One thing that makes this game stand out, compared to the others in my ePortfolio, is the ability to play the game through different cameras or viewpoints.  The original assignment asked us to make at least 2 other cameras, for a total of 3, but I decided to add a few more to get more familiar with how the cameras work.  To create the additional cameras, I made a CameraViews Actor and used C++ and Visual Studio 2017 to input the code.
